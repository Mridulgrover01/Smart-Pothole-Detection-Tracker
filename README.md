# Smart Pothole Detection & Repair Tracker

## Problem Statement
Road potholes cause accidents, vehicle damage, and poor urban mobility.
Current systems lack real-time reporting and accountability.

## Solution Overview
This project provides a smart web-based solution where citizens can report potholes
by uploading images. The system automatically captures the location and displays
reported potholes on a live interactive map.

Authorities can track reports and take necessary action efficiently.

## Key Features (Round 1)
* Pothole reporting using image upload
* Automatic GPS-based location capture
* Live map visualization using Leaflet
* Image preview on map markers
* Backend data storage
* Delete option for reported potholes


## Tech Stack
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Mapping: Leaflet.js + OpenStreetMap
* Backend: Python (Flask)
* Data Storage: JSON
* Image Upload Handling: Flask

## System Flow
1. User uploads a pothole image
2. Location is captured automatically
3. Data is sent to backend API
4. Backend stores data and image
5. Pothole appears on live map

## Current Status
* Fully functional prototype
* Frontend and backend connected
* Real-world pothole images supported
* Live map working successfully

## Planned Improvements for Round 2 (Mandatory)
* AI-based pothole detection from images
* Automatic severity classification
* Repair workflow (Reported → Assigned → Fixed)
* OTP-based confirmation after repair
* Analytics dashboard for authorities

## Impact
* Improves road safety
* Encourages citizen participation
* Brings transparency in repair process
* Enables data-driven road maintenance

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a practical and scalable solution for smart road
infrastructure management using technology and automation.
